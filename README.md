# Memory Bank

## Description
Ever seen the Pixar movie, Inside Out? In it, we get to see the emotions of the main character, Riley, portrayed as their own characters that live inside her head. Each memory is attached to a specific emotion, and whenever recalling certain memories, those associated emotions are brought as well. 

This application is a place to share memories and any associated emotions that may come along with them. With an element of social media and networking, you can have friends and see their associated memories as well. 

You can access the deployed version through the following link: **ADD LINK TO HEROKU HERE ONCE DEPLOYED**
